# Synonyms in Quran

This website is an attempt to help people with limited knowledge of Arabic to appreciate the beauty of Quranic language.

The goal is to collect different sysnonyms of the same words used in Quran, and discuss the subtle differences in their meaning, which are usually lost in translation.

This is an ongoing work and an undertaking which I don't feel equal to. But I am starting this massive project with the name of Allah and putting my trust in Allah's help.
