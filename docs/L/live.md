     سكن - تبوأ - ثوى - بدا - حضر - خلد - عاشر - غني 

!!! info "Synonyms in English"
    to populate, to settle in a place, to stay, to reside, to dwell

There are many words in Quran which have been translated as living or dwelling. Although these translations capture the gist of the meaning of Quranic words, they are not able to capture the underlying nuances of meaning in the original Arabic words. 

Let's take a look at all the words from Quran and their unique flavor.

## سكن
### Root letters
س - ك - ن

### Meaning
Sakana(سَكَنَ) or sakoon is the anotnym of unrest and motion. Thus when sakana is used in the context of ‘to settle in a land’ then it has the meaning of to arrive from some other place to settle. (:material-book: Maqaees)

### Examples from Quran

In the following ayaah, the word sakanah implies that their birth was at some other place other than Al-Jannah and then Allah settled them in it. (:material-book: MTFQ)

!!! quote "Surah al-Baqarah - 35"

    وَقُلْنَا يَا آدَمُ اسْكُنْ أَنْتَ وَزَوْجُكَ الْجَنَّةَ وَكُلَا مِنْهَا رَغَدًا حَيْثُ شِئْتُمَا وَلَا تَقْرَبَا هَٰذِهِ الشَّجَرَةَ فَتَكُونَا مِنَ الظَّالِمِينَ (1)
    </div></div>

    1. And We said: "O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in the Paradise and eat both of you freely with pleasure and delight, of things therein as wherever you will, but come not near this tree or you both will be of the Zâlimûn (wrong-doers)."

Similarly we see this word used again when Sayyadina Ibraheem (PBUH) moved his wife Hajira (Hagar) and Ismael (PBUH) from Palestine and settled them in the barren valley of Makkah.

!!! quote "Surah Ibraheem - 37"

    <div class="annotate" markdown>
    <div dir=rtl>
    رَبَّنَا إِنِّي أَسْكَنْتُ مِنْ ذُرِّيَّتِي بِوَادٍ غَيْرِ ذِي زَرْعٍ عِنْدَ بَيْتِكَ الْمُحَرَّمِ رَبَّنَا لِيُقِيمُوا الصَّلَاةَ فَاجْعَلْ أَفْئِدَةً مِنَ النَّاسِ تَهْوِي إِلَيْهِمْ وَارْزُقْهُمْ مِنَ الثَّمَرَاتِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَشْكُرُونَ   (1) 
    </div></div>

    1. O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring to dwell in an uncultivable valley by Your Sacred House (the Ka‘bah at Makkah) in order, O our Lord, that they may perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât). So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allâh) provide them with fruits so that they may give thanks


## تَبَوَّا 

### Root letters

ب - و - ء 

### Meaning

There are two connotations in its meaning:

1. Returning to a thing 
2. Being appropriate 

This word is used when the climate and surrounding of a residential place is suitable and favourable for the resident. (:material-book: MTFQ)

!!! quote "Surah Yusuf - 56"

    <div class="annotate" markdown>
    <div dir=rtl>
    وَكَذَٰلِكَ مَكَّنَّا لِيُوسُفَ فِي الْأَرْضِ يَتَبَوَّأُ مِنْهَا حَيْثُ يَشَاءُ ۚ نُصِيبُ بِرَحْمَتِنَا مَنْ نَشَاءُ ۖ وَلَا نُضِيعُ أَجْرَ الْمُحْسِنِينَ  (1)
    </div></div>
    
    1. And thus We established Joseph in the land to settle therein wherever he willed. We touch with Our mercy whom We will, and We do not allow to be lost the reward of those who do good.


Likewise Allah said to Muhammad (PBUH) when Muhammad (PBUH) was appointing the believers, each one to a specific place, as per the war strategy in the battleground.

!!! quote "Surah Aal-e-Imran - 121"

    <div class="annotate" markdown>
    <div dir=rtl>
    وَإِذْ غَدَوْتَ مِنْ أَهْلِكَ تُبَوِّئُ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ مَقَاعِدَ لِلْقِتَالِ ۗ وَاللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ   (1)
    </div></div>
    

    1. And (remember) when you (Muhammad (PBUH)) left your household in the morning to post the believers at their stations for the battle (of Uhud). And Allâh is All-Hearer, All-Knower.


## ثوى

### Root letters

ث - و - ي

### Meaning

It means to be buried, or to stay in the some place for a long time, to make some place a permanent abode, or to keep residence at a place since time of forefathers. (:material-book: MR)

ثوَى الرَّجُل means death of a man

الثّاية is a rock placed half burried at a place by a shepherd to mark the place where he can return at night. (:material-book: Maqaees)

 
!!! quote "Suraa al-Qasas - 45"

    <div class="annotate" markdown>
    <div dir=rtl>
    وَلَٰكِنَّا أَنْشَأْنَا قُرُونًا فَتَطَاوَلَ عَلَيْهِمُ الْعُمُرُ ۚ وَمَا كُنْتَ ثَاوِيًا فِي أَهْلِ مَدْيَنَ تَتْلُو عَلَيْهِمْ آيَاتِنَا وَلَٰكِنَّا كُنَّا مُرْسِلِينَ   (1)
    </div></div>

    1. But We created generations [after generations i.e. after Mûsâ (Moses (PBUH))], and long were the ages that passed over them. And you (O Muhammad (PBUH)) were not a dweller among the people of Madyan (Midian), reciting Our Verses to them. But it is We Who kept sending (Messengers).

Another derivative of this word is مثوى which means the place of abode, habitation, place of dwelling, a place where you live for a long time. Notice the meaning of staying in the same place for a long time is part of this word, with an undertone of staying burried, an undertone which is lost in the translated words.

This word has been used multiple times in Quran too.

!!! quote Surah al-Zumar - 60
    <div class="annotate" markdown>

    وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ تَرَى الَّذِينَ كَذَبُوا عَلَى اللَّهِ وُجُوهُهُمْ مُسْوَدَّةٌ ۚ أَلَيْسَ فِي جَهَنَّمَ مَثْوًى لِلْمُتَكَبِّرِينَ   (1)
    </div></div>

    1. And on the Day of Resurrection you will see those who lied against Allâh (i.e. attributed to Him sons, partners) - their faces will be black. Is there not in Hell an abode for the arrogant?

From here the meaning extended into a living in a place or habitat where the view is clear and unobstructed by buildings, such as a village, desert, or a far off place.

Some derived words are بَادِيَة meaning desert, بَادِي meaning desert dweller, and بَدَوِيٌ meaning villager.
