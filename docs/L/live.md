!!! info "Synonyms in English"
    to populate, to settle in a place, to stay, to reside, to dwell

There are many words in Quran which have been translated as living or dwelling. Although these translations capture the gist of the meaning of Quranic words, they are not able to capture the underlying nuances of meaning in the original Arabic words. 

Let's take a look at all the words from Quran and their unique flavor.

## سكن
### Root letters
س - ك - ن

### Meaning
Sakana(سَكَنَ) or sakoon is the antonym of unrest and motion. Thus when sakana is used in the context of ‘to settle in a land’ then it has the meaning of to arrive from some other place to settle[^MQL].

### Examples from Quran

In the following ayaah, the word sakanah implies that their birth was at some other place other than Al-Jannah and then Allah settled them in it[^MTFQ].

!!! quote "Surah al-Baqarah - 35"

    وَقُلْنَا يَا آدَمُ اسْكُنْ أَنْتَ وَزَوْجُكَ الْجَنَّةَ وَكُلَا مِنْهَا رَغَدًا حَيْثُ شِئْتُمَا وَلَا تَقْرَبَا هَٰذِهِ الشَّجَرَةَ فَتَكُونَا مِنَ الظَّالِمِينَ
    </div> (1) </div>

    1. And We said: "O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in the Paradise and eat both of you freely with pleasure and delight, of things therein as wherever you will, but come not near this tree or you both will be of the Zâlimûn (wrong-doers)."

Similarly we see this word used again when Sayyadina Ibraheem (PBUH) moved his wife Hajira (Hagar) and Ismael (PBUH) from Palestine and settled them in the barren valley of Makkah.

!!! quote "Surah Ibraheem - 37"

    <div class="annotate" markdown>
    <div dir=rtl>
    رَبَّنَا إِنِّي أَسْكَنْتُ مِنْ ذُرِّيَّتِي بِوَادٍ غَيْرِ ذِي زَرْعٍ عِنْدَ بَيْتِكَ الْمُحَرَّمِ رَبَّنَا لِيُقِيمُوا الصَّلَاةَ فَاجْعَلْ أَفْئِدَةً مِنَ النَّاسِ تَهْوِي إِلَيْهِمْ وَارْزُقْهُمْ مِنَ الثَّمَرَاتِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَشْكُرُونَ   
    </div> (1) </div>

    1. O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring to dwell in an uncultivable valley by Your Sacred House (the Ka‘bah at Makkah) in order, O our Lord, that they may perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât). So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allâh) provide them with fruits so that they may give thanks


## تَبَوَّا 

### Root letters

ب - و - ء 

### Meaning

There are two connotations in its meaning:

1. Returning to a thing 
2. Being appropriate 

This word is used when the climate and surrounding of a residential place is suitable and favourable for the resident[^MTFQ].

!!! quote "Surah Yusuf - 56"

    <div class="annotate" markdown>
    <div dir=rtl>
    وَكَذَٰلِكَ مَكَّنَّا لِيُوسُفَ فِي الْأَرْضِ يَتَبَوَّأُ مِنْهَا حَيْثُ يَشَاءُ ۚ نُصِيبُ بِرَحْمَتِنَا مَنْ نَشَاءُ ۖ وَلَا نُضِيعُ أَجْرَ الْمُحْسِنِينَ  
    </div> (1) </div>
    
    1. And thus We established Joseph in the land to settle therein wherever he willed. We touch with Our mercy whom We will, and We do not allow to be lost the reward of those who do good.


Likewise Allah said to Muhammad (PBUH) when Muhammad (PBUH) was appointing the believers, each one to a specific place, as per the war strategy in the battleground.

!!! quote "Surah Aal-e-Imran - 121"

    <div class="annotate" markdown>
    <div dir=rtl>
    وَإِذْ غَدَوْتَ مِنْ أَهْلِكَ تُبَوِّئُ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ مَقَاعِدَ لِلْقِتَالِ ۗ وَاللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ   
    </div> (1) </div>
    

    1. And (remember) when you (Muhammad (PBUH)) left your household in the morning to post the believers at their stations for the battle (of Uhud). And Allâh is All-Hearer, All-Knower.


## ثوى

### Root letters

ث - و - ي

### Meaning

It means to be buried, or to stay in the some place for a long time, to make some place a permanent abode, or to keep residence at a place since time of forefathers[^MR].

ثوَى الرَّجُل means death of a man

الثّاية is a rock placed half buried at a place by a shepherd to mark the place where he can return at night[^MQL].
 
!!! quote "Suraa al-Qasas - 45"

    <div class="annotate" markdown>
    <div dir=rtl>
    وَلَٰكِنَّا أَنْشَأْنَا قُرُونًا فَتَطَاوَلَ عَلَيْهِمُ الْعُمُرُ ۚ وَمَا كُنْتَ ثَاوِيًا فِي أَهْلِ مَدْيَنَ تَتْلُو عَلَيْهِمْ آيَاتِنَا وَلَٰكِنَّا كُنَّا مُرْسِلِينَ   
    </div> (1) </div>

    1. But We created generations [after generations i.e. after Mûsâ (Moses (PBUH))], and long were the ages that passed over them. And you (O Muhammad (PBUH)) were not a dweller among the people of Madyan (Midian), reciting Our Verses to them. But it is We Who kept sending (Messengers).

Another derivative of this word is مثوى which means the place of abode, habitation, place of dwelling, a place where you live for a long time. Notice the meaning of staying in the same place for a long time is part of this word, with an undertone of staying buried, an undertone which is lost in the translated words.

This word has been used multiple times in Quran too.

!!! quote "Surah al-Zumar - 60"
    <div class="annotate" markdown>
    <div dir=rtl>
    وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ تَرَى الَّذِينَ كَذَبُوا عَلَى اللَّهِ وُجُوهُهُمْ مُسْوَدَّةٌ ۚ أَلَيْسَ فِي جَهَنَّمَ مَثْوًى لِلْمُتَكَبِّرِينَ   
    </div> (1) </div>

    1. And on the Day of Resurrection you will see those who lied against Allâh (i.e. attributed to Him sons, partners) - their faces will be black. Is there not in Hell an abode for the arrogant?

    <div class="annotate" markdown>
    <div dir=rtl>
    فَإِن يَصْبِرُوا فَالنَّارُ مَثْوًى لَّهُمْ ۖ وَإِن يَسْتَعْتِبُوا فَمَا هُم مِّنَ الْمُعْتَبِينَ  
    </div> (1) </div>

    1. Then, if they bear the torment patiently, then the Fire is the home for them, and if they seek to please Allâh, yet they are not of those who will ever be allowed to please Allâh.

    </div> (1) </div>

    1. And perform properly (i.e. all the ceremonies according to the ways of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)), the Hajj and ‘Umrah (i.e. the pilgrimage to Makkah) for Allâh. But if you are prevented (from completing them), sacrifice a Hady (animal, i.e. a sheep, a cow, or a camel) such as you can afford, and do not shave your heads until the Hady reaches the place of sacrifice. And whosoever of you is ill or has an ailment in his scalp (necessitating shaving), he must pay a Fidyah (ransom) of either observing Saum (fasts) (three days) or giving Sadaqah (charity - feeding six poor persons) or offering sacrifice (one sheep). Then if you are in safety and whosoever performs the ‘Umrah in the months of Hajj before (performing) the Hajj, (i.e. Hajj-at-Tamattu‘ and Al-Qirân), he must slaughter a Hady such as he can afford, but if he cannot afford it, he should observe Saum (fasts) three days during the Hajj and seven days after his return (to his home), making ten days in all. This is for him whose family is not present at Al-Masjid-Al-Harâm (i.e. non-resident of Makkah). And fear Allâh much and know that Allâh is Severe in punishment.

## بدا

### Root letters

ب - د - و

### Meaning

The literal meaning of this word is to be apparent. And it is used in this sense in Surah al-Zumar.

!!! quote "Surah al-Zumar - 47"
    <div class="annotate" markdown>
    <div dir=rtl>
    وَلَوْ أَنَّ لِلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا مَا فِي الْأَرْضِ جَمِيعًا وَمِثْلَهُ مَعَهُ لَافْتَدَوْا بِهِ مِن سُوءِ الْعَذَابِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ ۚ وَبَدَا لَهُم مِّنَ اللَّهِ مَا لَمْ يَكُونُوا يَحْتَسِبُونَ  
    </div> (1) </div>

    1. And those who did wrong (the polytheists and disbelievers in the Oneness of Allâh), if they had all that is in earth and therewith as much again, they verily, would offer it to ransom themselves therewith on the Day of Resurrection from the evil torment; and there will become apparent to them from Allâh what they had not been reckoning.
    

From here the meaning extended into a living in a place or habitat where the view is clear and unobstructed by buildings, such as a village, desert, or a far off place.

Some derived words are بَادِيَة meaning desert, بَادِي meaning desert dweller, and بَدَوِيٌ meaning villager.

In Quran we find refernce to the derived word بدو in Surah Yusuf.

!!! quote "Surah Yusuf - 100"
    <div class="annotate" markdown>
    <div dir=rtl>
    وَرَفَعَ أَبَوَيْهِ عَلَى الْعَرْشِ وَخَرُّوا لَهُ سُجَّدًا ۖ وَقَالَ يَا أَبَتِ هَٰذَا تَأْوِيلُ رُؤْيَايَ مِن قَبْلُ قَدْ جَعَلَهَا رَبِّي حَقًّا ۖ وَقَدْ أَحْسَنَ بِي إِذْ أَخْرَجَنِي مِنَ السِّجْنِ وَجَاءَ بِكُم مِّنَ الْبَدْوِ مِن بَعْدِ أَن نَّزَغَ الشَّيْطَانُ بَيْنِي وَبَيْنَ إِخْوَتِي ۚ إِنَّ رَبِّي لَطِيفٌ لِّمَا يَشَاءُ ۚ إِنَّهُ هُوَ الْعَلِيمُ الْحَكِيمُ 
    </div> (1) </div>

    1. And he raised his parents to the throne and they fell down before him prostrate. And he said: "O my father! This is the interpretation of my dream aforetime! My Lord has made it come true! He was indeed good to me, when He took me out of the prison, and brought you (all here) out of the bedouin-life, after Shaitân (Satan) had sown enmity between me and my brothers. Certainly, my Lord is the Most Courteous and Kind unto whom He wills. Truly He! Only He is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.


## عاشر 

### Root letters

ع - ش - ر

### Meaning

The root word has two basic meanings:

1. Count of ten
2. Associate with one another, to live together. 

From this we get the derived word عشيرة which means clan, kinsfolk, or tribe.

So عاشر means to live closely as a family, to be on intimate terms with someone, to associate closely with someone[^MTFQ].

!!! quote "Surah An-Nisaa - 19"
    <div class="annotate" markdown>
    <div dir=rtl>
    يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا يَحِلُّ لَكُمْ أَن تَرِثُوا النِّسَاءَ كَرْهًا ۖ وَلَا تَعْضُلُوهُنَّ لِتَذْهَبُوا بِبَعْضِ مَا آتَيْتُمُوهُنَّ إِلَّا أَن يَأْتِينَ بِفَاحِشَةٍ مُّبَيِّنَةٍ ۚ وَعَاشِرُوهُنَّ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ ۚ فَإِن كَرِهْتُمُوهُنَّ فَعَسَىٰ أَن تَكْرَهُوا شَيْئًا وَيَجْعَلَ اللَّهُ فِيهِ خَيْرًا كَثِيرًا 
    </div> (1) </div>

    1. O you who believe! You are forbidden to inherit women against their will; and you should not treat them with harshness, that you may take away part of the Mahr you have given them, unless they commit open illegal sexual intercourse; and live with them honourably. If you dislike them, it may be that you dislike a thing and Allâh brings through it a great deal of good.


## غني

### Root letters

غ - ن - ي 

This word means to be free from want, not to need anything.

غَنِيَ بِلمَكَانِ  means to live at a place for a long time with peace and comfort as if that person is free from a need of other places[^MQL]. 

!!! quote "Surah al-A'raf - 92"
    <div class="annotate" markdown>
    <div dir=rtl>
    الَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا شُعَيْبًا كَأَن لَّمْ يَغْنَوْا فِيهَا ۚ الَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا شُعَيْبًا كَانُوا هُمُ الْخَاسِرِينَ 
    </div> (1) </div>
