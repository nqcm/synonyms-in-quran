## سكن

### Root Letters: 
س ك ن

### Meaning:

The word سكن is a comprehensive word. It means to rest after movement and turmoil[^MQL], to be at peace, to be tranquil and calm. That's why this word has also been used to settle in a place. (See [to settle](../L/live.md)).

This word and it's noun سكون are used in both physical and conceptual meaning. So, it not only means to rest after physical exhaustion, but also to find peace after mental turmoil[^MTFQ].

### Examples from Quran
In the following ayaah, the word سكن is used in the meaning of physical rest.

    1. It is out of His Mercy that He has made for you the night and the day that you may rest therein (i.e. during the night) and that you may seek of His Bounty (i.e. during the day) - and in order that you may be grateful.

And in the following ayaah, the word سكن is used in the meaning of mental peace.

    </div> (1) </div>

    1. Take Sadaqah (alms) from their wealth in order to purify them and sanctify them with it, and invoke Allâh for them. Verily! Your invocations are a source of security for them; and Allâh is All-Hearer, All-Knower.

## سبت

### Root Letters:
س ب ت

### Meaning:
The basic meaning of this word is peace and tranquality[^MQL], or a rest after which relief or comfort is achieved[^MR]. We can use this word for a good night's sleep that results in waking up refreshed and rested. This word is also used for the day of rest, the Sabbath, which is observed by Jews on Saturday and by Christians on Sunday.

### Examples from Quran

!!! quote "Surah al-Naba - 9"

    <div class="annotate" markdown>
    <div dir=rtl>
    وَجَعَلْنَا نَوْمَكُمْ سُبَاتًا    
    </div> (1) </div>

    1. And We have made your sleep as a thing for rest.

## ارتفق

### Root Letters:
ر ف ق

### Meaning:

The meaning of the root رفق is to be kind, friendly, nice, and favourable. So جميعة الرفق بالحيوانات means the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals, literally the society for kindness to animals[^HW].

It also means a close companionship that is free from harshness and severity. 

The derivatives of the roots are used for everything that results in comfort and favourability[^MTFQ].

For example, مِرفق is the elbow as it used to suport one's self while leaning or resting. It is also used for the armrest of an easy chair[^HW], or a comfortable house or apartment[^HW]. With the same logic مِرفقه is a small pillow. And إِرتَفَاق is such a companionship which results in comfort and peace. 

In Quran we find the word مُرْتَفَق, which is a resting place where there is comfort and no disturbance. Interstingly, we find this word used in Quran for Jahannam, the Hellfire.

### Examples from Quran

In the following ayaah, the word مُرْتَفَق is used for the resting place of the disbelievers in Hellfire.

!!! quote "Surah al-Kahaf - 29"

    <div class="annotate" markdown>
    <div dir=rtl>
    وَقُلِ الْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّكُمْ ۖ فَمَن شَاءَ فَلْيُؤْمِن وَمَن شَاءَ فَلْيَكْفُرْ ۚ إِنَّا أَعْتَدْنَا لِلظَّالِمِينَ نَارًا أَحَاطَ بِهِمْ سُرَادِقُهَا ۚ وَإِن يَسْتَغِيثُوا يُغَاثُوا بِمَاءٍ كَالْمُهْلِ يَشْوِي الْوُجُوهَ ۚ بِئْسَ الشَّرَابُ وَسَاءَتْ مُرْتَفَقًا     
    </div> (1) </div>

    1. And say: "The truth is from your Lord." Then whosoever wills, let him believe; and whosoever wills, let him disbelieve. Verily, We have prepared for the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers.), a Fire whose walls will be surrounding them (disbelievers in the Oneness of Allâh). And if they ask for help (relief, water), they will be granted water like boiling oil, that will scald their faces. Terrible is the drink, and an evil Murtafaq (dwelling, resting place.)!

And in the same surah we find the word مُرْتَفَق is used for the resting place of the believers in Paradise.

!!! quote "Surah al-Kahaf - 31"

    <div class="annotate" markdown>
    <div dir=rtl>
    أُولَٰئِكَ لَهُمْ جَنَّاتُ عَدْنٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهِمُ الْأَنْهَارُ يُحَلَّوْنَ فِيهَا مِنْ أَسَاوِرَ مِن ذَهَبٍ وَيَلْبَسُونَ ثِيَابًا خُضْرًا مِّن سُندُسٍ وَإِسْتَبْرَقٍ مُّتَّكِئِينَ فِيهَا عَلَى الْأَرَائِكِ ۚ نِعْمَ الثَّوَابُ وَحَسُنَتْ مُرْتَفَقًا     
    </div> (1) </div>

    1. These! For them will be ‘Adn (Eden) Paradise (everlasting Gardens); wherein rivers flow underneath them; therein they will be adorned with bracelets of gold, and they will wear green garments of fine and thick silk. They will recline therein on raised thrones. How good is the reward, and what an excellent Murtafaq (dwelling, resting place.)!

In the following ayaah we find the plural of the word مرفق meaing elbows.

!!! quote "Surah al-Maidaah - 6"

    <div class="annotate" markdown>
    <div dir=rtl>
    يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِذَا قُمْتُمْ إِلَى الصَّلَاةِ فَاغْسِلُوا وُجُوهَكُمْ وَأَيْدِيَكُمْ إِلَى الْمَرَافِقِ وَامْسَحُوا بِرُءُوسِكُمْ وَأَرْجُلَكُمْ إِلَى الْكَعْبَيْنِ ۚ    
    </div> (1) </div>

    1. O you who believe, when you rise for Salāh, (prayer) wash your faces and your hands up to the elbows, and make MasH (wiping by hands) of your heads and (wash) your feet up to the ankles.
