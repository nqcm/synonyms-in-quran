# Sources

Below are the sources I will use for this project. I will try my best to give a refernce of the various books as I quote them.

## فقه اللغة - ثعالبي

## الفروق اللغوية - عسكري

## غريب القرآن - ابن قتيبة

## مقائيس اللغة - ابن الفارس
"Maqaees al-Lughah" (مقاييس اللغة) is a classical Arabic lexicon authored by the renowned linguist Ibn Faris (ابن فارس). The book is a significant contribution to Arabic philology and lexicography. Ibn Faris's approach in this work is to trace the roots of Arabic words and categorize them based on their fundamental meanings. He meticulously examines the etymology and semantic development of words, providing insights into their original meanings and how they have evolved over time.

## مفردات إمام راغب

## مترادفات القرآن - عبدالرحمن كيلاني
I am going to lean heavily on this book, which is an excellent (and possibly unique) book in Urdu on this topic. For many words just a translation of his work would suffice. But for other words I am going to add more content based on my personal research, InShaAllah!

## المنجد
An Arabic to Urdu dictionary. It is the translation of an Arabic to arabic dictionary compiled by an orientalist named Louise Malouf.
