# Sources

Below are the sources I will use for this project. I will try my best to give a refernce of the various books as I quote them.

## Fiqh-al-Lughah by Thaalabi

## Ghareeb-al-Quran by ibn Qutaybah

## Maqaees-al-Lughah

## Mufradat-al-Quran by Imam Raghib al-Asfahani

## Mutaraadifaat-al-Quran by Abdur Rahman Kilani
I am going to lean heavily on this book, which is an excellent (and possibly unique) book in Urdu on this topic. For many words just a translation of his work would suffice. But for other words I am going to add more content based on my personal research, InShaAllah!

I am also using this [blog](http://quransynonym.blogspot.com/) to copy translations of some entries from this book.
