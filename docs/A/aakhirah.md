# Aakhirah

!!! abstract "Arabic words used for this meaning in Quran"
    آخرة - دار الآخرة - دار القرار

!!! info "Synonyms in English"
    Hereafter, Next world, Life after death, Eternal abode

Aakhirah is the Arabic word for the Hereafter. It is derived from the root letters "ءخر" which means "to be last" or "to be behind".

The word Aakhirah, which is actually short for الحياة الآخرة,  is used in the Quran to refer to the life after death, the life in the Hereafter, the life in the next world, the life in the world to come, the life in the world of the unseen! The eternal life one will get after death in this world. When the bodies and the souls will reunite again. The life that will be full of rewards or punishments based on the deeds done in this world.

The opposite of Aakhirah is "Dunya" (الحياة الدنيا) which means "this world" or "this life". The word Dunya is the comparative word derived from the root letters "دنو" which means "to be near" or "to be close". So الحياة الدنيا actually means the closer life. Interestingly, when we refer to this world as dunya or the closer world, we are accepting the existence of aakhirah - the further world. Other words which are used in Quran as antonyms of Aakhirah are عاجلة, أولى, and أدنى.

    وَالَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِمَا أُنزِلَ إِلَيْكَ وَمَا أُنزِلَ مِن قَبْلِكَ وَبِالْآخِرَةِ هُمْ يُوقِنُونَ
    </div> (1) </div>

    1. And who believe in (the Qur’ân and the Sunnah ) which has been sent down (revealed) to you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) and in that which was sent down before you [the Taurât (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel), etc.] and they believe with certainty in the Hereafter. (Resurrection, recompense of their good and bad deeds, Paradise and Hell).

## دار الآخرة

This eternal life is also referred to as "دار الآخرة" (Daar al-Aakhirah) in the Quran. The word "دار" can be translated as "home" or "abode". But this word is very comprehensive in its meaning. It can be used for a house, or town, area, country, even Earth as a home for humans. So this world is دار الدنيا and Aakhirah or دار الآخرة is the home in the Hereafter.

But in this furthest life, everyone will be rewarded an abode depending on their deeds in this world.

    وَقِيلَ لِلَّذِينَ اتَّقَوْا مَاذَا أَنزَلَ رَبُّكُمْ ۚ قَالُوا خَيْرًا ۗ لِّلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُوا فِي هَٰذِهِ الدُّنْيَا حَسَنَةٌ ۚ وَلَدَارُ الْآخِرَةِ خَيْرٌ ۚ وَلَنِعْمَ دَارُ الْمُتَّقِينَ
    </div> (1) </div>

    1. And (when) it is said to those who are the Muttaqûn (the pious - See V.2:2) "What is it that your Lord has sent down?" They say: "That which is good." For those who do good in this world, there is good, and the home of the Hereafter will be better. And excellent indeed will be the home (i.e. Paradise) of the Muttaqûn.

    وَالَّذِينَ يَنقُضُونَ عَهْدَ اللَّهِ مِن بَعْدِ مِيثَاقِهِ وَيَقْطَعُونَ مَا أَمَرَ اللَّهُ بِهِ أَن يُوصَلَ وَيُفْسِدُونَ فِي الْأَرْضِ ۙ أُولَٰئِكَ لَهُمُ اللَّعْنَةُ وَلَهُمْ سُوءُ الدَّارِ
    </div> (1) </div>

    1. And those who break the Covenant of Allâh, after its ratification, and sever that which Allâh has commanded to be joined (i.e. they sever the bond of kinship and are not good to their relatives), and work mischief in the land, on them is the curse (i.e. they will be far away from Allâh’s Mercy), and for them is the unhappy (evil) home (i.e. Hell).

    </div> (1) </div>

    1. Have you not seen those who have changed the Blessings of Allâh into disbelief (by denying Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم and his Message of Islâm), and caused their people to dwell in the house of destruction?



## دار القرار

Another word used in the Quran for the Hereafter is "دار القرار" (Daar al-Qarar). The word "قرار" means "to settle" or "to stay". So this word is used to refer to the eternal abode where one will settle down forever. This word as used in the Quran has a positive association, as it is used to refer to the final abode of the righteous people. 

For the disbelievers the word used is بئس القرار which means "evil abode" or "evil settlement".

    </div> (1) </div>

    1. "O my people! Truly, this life of the world is nothing but a (quick passing) enjoyment, and verily, the Hereafter that is the home that will remain forever."

    </div> (1) </div>

    1. (The followers of the misleaders will say): "Nay, you (too)! No welcome for you! It is you (misleaders) who brought this upon us (because you misled us in the world), so evil is this place to stay in!"
