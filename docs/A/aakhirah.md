!!! info "Synonyms in English"

Aakhirah is the Arabic word for the Hereafter. It is derived from the root letters "ءخر" which means "to be last" or "to be behind".

The word Aakhirah, which is actually short for الحياة الآخرة,  is used in the Quran to refer to the life after death, the life in the Hereafter, the life in the next world, the life in the world to come, the life in the world of the unseen! The eternal life one will get after death in this world. When the bodies and the souls will reunite again. The life that will be full of rewards or punishments based on the deeds done in this world.

The opposite of Aakhirah is "Dunya" (الحياة الدنيا) means "this world" or "this life". The word Dunya is the comparative word derived from the root letters "دنو" which means "to be near" or "to be close". So الحياة الدنيا actually means the closer life. Interestingly, when we refer to this world as dunya or the closer world, we are accepting the existence of aakhirah - the further world. Other words which are used in quran as antonyms of Aakhirah are عاجلة, أولى, and أدنى.

## دار الآخرة

This eternal life is also referred to as "دار الآخرة" (Daar al-Aakhirah) in the Quran. The word "دار" can be translated as "home" or "abode". But this word is very comprehensive in its meaning. It can be used for a house, or town, area, country, even Earth as a home for humans. So this world is دار الدنيا and Aakhirah or دار الآخرة is the home in the Hereafter.

But in this furthest life, everyone will be rewarded an abode depending on their deeds in this world.
