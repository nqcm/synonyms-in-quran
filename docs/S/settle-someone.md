    <div dir=rtl>
    وَكَذَٰلِكَ مَكَّنَّا لِيُوسُفَ فِي الْأَرْضِ يَتَبَوَّأُ مِنْهَا حَيْثُ يَشَاءُ ۚ نُصِيبُ بِرَحْمَتِنَا مَنْ نَشَاءُ ۖ وَلَا نُضِيعُ أَجْرَ الْمُحْسِنِينَ  
    </div> (1) </div>
    
    1. And thus We established Joseph in the land to settle therein wherever he willed. We touch with Our mercy whom We will, and We do not allow to be lost the reward of those who do good.


## عمر

### Root letters

ع - م - ر

### Meaning

It means to make something full of life, to make it thrive, to make someone or some place prosperous. (:material-book: MTFQ)

According to ibn Faaris it also has the meaning of preservation, longivity and persistence. (:material-book: Maqaees)

Sometimes we can capture the meaning of a word better if we look at its opposite. The opposite of عمر (as an intransitive verb) is to destroy, to ruin, to wreck, to vandalize. (:material-book: MTFQ). So عمر means to make something thrive and prosper, and the opposite of it is to destroy something.

We find both these words in a single hadeeth. While describing the signs of near Qiyamah, Rasulullah (ﷺ) said:

مساجدها عامرة وهي خراب من الهدى

The meaning of this hadeeth is that the masjids will be full of people, but they will be devoid of guidance.
