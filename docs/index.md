# Synonyms in Quran

This website is an attempt to help people with limited knowledge of Arabic to appreciate the beauty of Quranic language.

The goal is to collect different sysnonyms of the same words used in Quran, and discuss the subtle differences in their meaning, which are usually lost in translation.

This is an ongoing work and an undertaking which I don't feel equal to. But I am starting this massive project with the name of Allah and putting my trust in Allah's help.

## How to use this site

This website has an index of words in English that have been used in Quran. Each English word contains all the Arabic words that have been used to convey the meaning of that particular word, their root letters, their meanings from various dictionaries and (optionally) a summary to show the subtle differences between these words and its usage.

For example, to find the different words used in Quran for "ship" go to the letter "S" link from the section below. Then click on the link for word "Ship".
